# Sweet Lift Taxi Project
Sweet Lift is a taxi company that has collected historical data on taxi orders at airports. To attract more drivers during peak hours, we need to predict the number of taxi orders for the next hour. 

## Objective
Create a model that is capable of making such predictions.

## Project Notes
- The RMSE metric on the test set should not be more than 48.
- Create several models then compare the models, find the model that has better RMSE value and prediction time
